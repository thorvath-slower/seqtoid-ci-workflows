# seqtoid-ci-workflows — shared reusable CI workflows

The single source of truth for cross-repo CI gating on the platform (CZID-310). Instead of each repo
carrying its own copy of the same scan (which drifts), every repo calls the reusable workflow here. One
definition, updated once, used everywhere.

**SSOT propagation:** callers pin to the moving major tag `@v1`. Change the reusable workflow here, move
`v1`, and every caller picks it up with **no downstream edit**. (Renamed from `ci-workflows`; also hosts
the `flake8-action` collapsed in from its former standalone repo.)

## Available workflows

### `security.yml` — reusable security scan
gitleaks (secrets) + trivy (vuln + misconfig, hard-fail HIGH/CRITICAL — secrets are gitleaks' job, not trivy's) + tflint + opt-in checkov.

**Call it from a repo** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`):

```yaml
name: security
on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  merge_group:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      run_checkov:
        type: boolean
        default: false

jobs:
  security:
    uses: thorvath-slower/seqtoid-ci-workflows/.github/workflows/security.yml@v1
    with:
      run_checkov: ${{ inputs.run_checkov || false }}
```

- The reusable's jobs check out the **caller's** repo, so each repo keeps its own **`.trivyignore`** baseline
  (CZID-264: accept inherited findings, hard-fail on NEW).
- Public repo, so any platform repo (public or private) can call it without an org-access setting.

### `terraform-ci.yml` — reusable Terraform fmt + validate gate
`terraform fmt -check` + per-stack (or custom) `terraform validate -backend=false` + optional codegen +
optional per-stack provider-lockfile pin (CZID-30). Pure correctness — no cloud creds / remote state.
(Converted from the earlier OpenTofu gate — the platform reverted OpenTofu → native Terraform, #370.)

**Call it from a repo** (`.github/workflows/terraform-ci.yml`):

```yaml
name: terraform-ci
on:
  push: { branches: [main] }
  pull_request:

jobs:
  terraform-ci:
    uses: thorvath-slower/seqtoid-ci-workflows/.github/workflows/terraform-ci.yml@v1
    with:
      fmt_path: infra/          # what to `terraform fmt -check -recursive`
      check_lockfile: true      # per-stack .terraform.lock.hcl pin gate (optional)
      stacks: |                 # each dir gets init(-backend=false) + validate
        infra/state-foundation/foundation
        infra/state-foundation/consumers/seqtoid-web
```

- Inputs: `fmt_path`, `stacks` (newline list) **or** `validate_command` (e.g. `make validate`, or a
  codegen+root validate), `prepare` (codegen, run after fmt), `check_lockfile`, `terraform_version`
  (default `latest`). The git-over-HTTPS config for public modules is built in.
- Repos with a more capable, repo-specific gate (e.g. cypherid-web-infra's changed-files + tiered
  validation) keep their own — uniformity only where it doesn't lose function.

## Versioning

Pin to `@v1` (a moving major tag). Breaking changes bump the major. Renovate keeps the pinned tool/action
versions inside the reusable current.

## Actions

- **`flake8-action/`** — Python flake8 linter action (collapsed in from the standalone
  `thorvath-slower/flake8-action` repo). Consume as
  `uses: thorvath-slower/seqtoid-ci-workflows/flake8-action@v1`.
