# ci-workflows — shared reusable CI workflows

The single source of truth for cross-repo CI gating on the platform. Instead of each repo
carrying its own copy of the same scan (which drifts), every repo calls the reusable workflow here. One
definition, updated once, used everywhere.

Mirrors the `thorvath-slower/flake8-action@v2` SSOT pattern — pin callers to a tag (`@v1`).

## Available workflows

### `security.yml` — reusable security scan
gitleaks (secrets) + trivy (vuln + misconfig, hard-fail HIGH/CRITICAL — secrets are gitleaks' job, not trivy's) + tflint + opt-in checkov.

**Call it from a repo** (`.github/workflows/security.yml`):

```yaml
name: security
on:
  push:
  pull_request:
  merge_group:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      run_checkov:
        type: boolean
        default: false

jobs:
  security:
    uses: thorvath-slower/ci-workflows/.github/workflows/security.yml@v1
    with:
      run_checkov: ${{ inputs.run_checkov || false }}
```

- The reusable's jobs check out the **caller's** repo, so each repo keeps its own **`.trivyignore`** baseline
  (accept inherited findings, hard-fail on NEW).
- Public repo, so any platform repo (public or private) can call it without an org-access setting.

### `tofu-ci.yml` — reusable OpenTofu fmt + validate gate
`tofu fmt -check` + per-stack (or custom) `tofu validate -backend=false` + optional codegen + optional
per-stack provider-lockfile pin. Pure correctness — no cloud creds / remote state.

**Call it from a repo** (`.github/workflows/tofu-ci.yml`):

```yaml
name: tofu-ci
on:
  push: { branches: [main] }
  pull_request:

jobs:
  tofu-ci:
    uses: thorvath-slower/ci-workflows/.github/workflows/tofu-ci.yml@v1
    with:
      fmt_path: infra/          # what to `tofu fmt -check -recursive`
      check_lockfile: true      # per-stack .terraform.lock.hcl pin gate (optional)
      stacks: |                 # each dir gets init(-backend=false) + validate
        infra/state-foundation/foundation
        infra/state-foundation/consumers/seqtoid-web
```

- Inputs: `fmt_path`, `stacks` (newline list) **or** `validate_command` (e.g. `make validate`, or a
  codegen+root validate), `prepare` (codegen, run after fmt), `check_lockfile`, `tofu_version_file`
  (default `.opentofu-version`). The git-over-HTTPS config for public modules is built in.
- Repos with a more capable, repo-specific gate (e.g. cypherid-web-infra's changed-files + tiered
  validation) keep their own — uniformity only where it doesn't lose function.

## Versioning

Pin to `@v1` (a moving major tag). Breaking changes bump the major. Renovate keeps the pinned tool/action
versions inside the reusable current.
